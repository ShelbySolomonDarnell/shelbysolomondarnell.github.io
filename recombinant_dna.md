#### DNA Sequencing trace
__Sera Thornton__
This is an example of sequencing results shown as a chromatogram. Each peak of a different color indicates a different base in the sequence.

#### Restriction enzyme sites
__Sera Thornton, :copyright: 2013 Broad Institute__
Here are several examples of restriction enzyme sites. Notice the diversity in length and sequence of the recognition sequences as well as how the enzyme cuts.
