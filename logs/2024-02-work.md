### Week 6

#### 05
+ [] editing `An Expert System for GeneNetwork`
+ make explicit mention of the following:
    + [] utilization of unstructured data
    + [] what problem we working to solve
    + [] speeding up evaluation of genes for systems genetics
    + [] using a FAIR web based knowledge graph for RAG
    + [] using AI to map addiction and behavioral traits to get causal gene variants
    + [] evaluation and ranking of candidate genes
    + [] gene reference into function (generif)
    + [] implement tunable parameters for high impact amino acid substitutions, candidate gene evaluation really needs and AI system with tunable parameters
    + [] reducing the ignorance about the functions of most genes and their many variants and isoforms
+ locus - a specific, fixed position on a chromosome where a particular gene or genetic marker is located
+ gene isoform mRNAs produced from the same locus while starting from different transcription start sites
+ [] modifying aims in DivSupl
    + [] back and forth with Pjotr
+ [] adding references, Meta's Llama, Mamba-SSM
