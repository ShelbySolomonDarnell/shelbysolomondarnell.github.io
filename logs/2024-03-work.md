#### Multiscale modeling Alzheimer's disease and its related dementias

The goal of this NOFO is to establish a computational multi-scale model recapitulating dynamic changes associated with aging across scales. Therefore, the proposed framework must:
 + Bridge at least two levels of analysis on the spatial scale (e.g., molecules, cells, tissues, organisms, behavior), 
 + or Bridge at least two levels of analysis on the temporal scale (spanning from milliseconds to generations). 
 
 Along with the framework, the application must:
+ Address a targeted research question through a targeted model to provide new insights into the function or dynamics of biology, disease, or a behavioral system.
+ Include at least one aim centered on hypothesis testing.
+ Include at least one aim on model validation.

Examples of appropriate topics may include, but are not limited to, the development of a multi-scale computational framework modeling aging and AD/ADRD based on the following:

1. Aging clocks (e.g., epigenetic clocks, PhenoAge, GrimAge, Dunedin Pace of Aging, etc.; proteomic clocks, neuroimaging age predictors). 
1. Hallmarks of aging (e.g., genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, disabled macroautophagy, deregulated nutrient-sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, altered intercellular communication, chronic inflammation, and dysbiosis). 
1. Oscillations in energetics and/or metabolism with aging, including brain energetics, frequency bands, and their relationship to behavioral and other biological outputs. Age-related changes in synaptic activity across scales, which can also include how these changes are related to motor, sensory, and cognitive domains.
1. Image-based analysis of aging function, biology and disease for the purposes of constructing multi-scale models of aging. Dynamic patterns of interventions to promote healthy aging (e.g., intermittent fasting)

#### Developing  research questions for Aging Multiscale modeling

I am interested in creating a model based off of findings in the U19 GAIM research, and some BCI data related to AD/RD.
